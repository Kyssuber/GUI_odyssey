# GUI_odyssey
Various scripts to test the functionality of tkinter. See the 'tutorials' folder.

I have also created a GUI to examine 2D fits images in the user's current directory, with a few neat features (ability to change image's color scheme; save current image as a .png; display a pixel's value Cartesian coordinates, RA DEC coordinates after a left-click event on the image canvas). I will continue updating this particular script as additional ideas appear in that smooth organ encased in my skull.

(Both versions of display_fits*.py are operational; the "OOP" will be the most current version of my tinkering (pun wholly intended) as I navigate object-oriented programming as a helpful organization strategy for my ever-growing code.)

ULTIMATE AIM: create a user-interface for the sonification project (see the 'research' repository).

To run: 

> python display_fits_OOP.py

Alternatively, 

> ipython
> 
> %run _____/display_fits_OOP.py
