# GUI_odyssey
Various scripts to test the functionality of tkinter. 

I have also created a GUI to examine 2D fits images in the user's current directory, with a few neat features (ability to change image's color scheme; save current image as a .png; display a pixel's value Cartesian coordinates, RA DEC coordinates after a left-click event on the image canvas). I will continue updating this particular script as additional ideas appear in that smooth organ encased in my skull.
